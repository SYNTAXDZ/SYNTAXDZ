# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

👋 Hi, I’m @SYNTAXDZ! I have a deep passion for blending technology and art. As a versatile maker, I love experimenting with electronics, developing embedded systems, and delving into computer graphics and 3D art. My constant drive to learn and create pushes me to explore new possibilities and bring innovative ideas to life. Whether I'm designing custom PCBs or crafting beautiful 3D renders, I'm always eager for new challenges and dedicated to achieving the highest quality results.

## Projects

Take a look at some of my featured projects:
- **[Experimental GameEngine](https://github.com/SYNTAXDZ/FirstGameEngine):** FirstGameEngine is a Work In Progress project. it aim to be simple and educational 3D game engine developed in C++. It provides a basic framework for building 3D games, making it ideal for beginners and educational purposes. 
- **[Educational Low Level Game  ](https://github.com/SYNTAXDZ/simpleOpenGLGame):** simpleOpenGLGame is a basic 2D game developed using only OpenGL. It serves as an educational project to demonstrate fundamental game development concepts, including rendering, input handling, and simple game mechanics using the OpenGL graphics API.
- **[A Custom STM32 Board](https://github.com/MILOUDIAS/Basic_STM32_Dev_Board):** Easy to use custom STM32 board offers versatile peripherals for IoT, automation, and robotics projects. Compact design with integrated programming/debugging support.(WIP)
- **[Embedded AI-Based Video Surveillance System Implemented on a Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/MILOUDIAS/object_detection_counting):** this project is a cost-effective, AI-based video surveillance system implemented on a Raspberry Pi, offering real-time object detection and counting. It leverages Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow for efficient edge computing and enhanced security applications.
